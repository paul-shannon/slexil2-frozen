# slexil2

This repo, slexil2, is a small work in progress, a modest refactoring
of the core original
[SLEXIL](https://github.com/davidjamesbeck/slexil), a collaborative
effort
between me and linguist Davd Beck.  I have undertaken this project to
remind myself of best coding and project structuring practices in
Python, after several years working primarily in <b><i>R</i></b>.


## Software Linking ELAN XML to Illuminated Language ##

The name builds upon the Lushootseed word for daylight, "sl…ôxil", a
central topic in the origin story told by Sauk-Suittale elder, Harry
Moses - a story which both Beck (professionally) and Shannon
(informally) have spent much on time.

I am grateful to David for his patience over the years as he guided me
through the intracies of this beautiful language, the inner secrets of
ELAN XML, and as we both knocked our heads against thorny parsing problems.

This software is documented in the journal *Language Documentation and Conservation*
[here](https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/24948/beck_shannon.pdf),
with main github repository
[here](https://github.com/davidjamesbeck/slexil).

Field linguists often transcribe and annotate  oral stories in a complex and
flexible XML called
[ELAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELAN_software).  slexil
transforms that xml, and accompanying audio, into a modestly
interactive webpage.  We use the first three lines of Dante's Inferno,
read by Roberto Benigni, to test and demonstrate the software.  The
live result can be viewed and heard
[here](https://pshannon.net/inferno/).
